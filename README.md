# Predict the age of ultrabasic melts from geochemical data


Volcanoes play a crucial role in bringing Earth's interior gases and magma to the surface, creating ultrabasic melts and ultra-mafic rocks. In specific instances, these eruptions lead to serpentinizationâ€”a process where ultrabasic melts react with water, forming hydrogen and methane. These serpentinization products can serve as energy sources for microorganisms, potentially contributing to the development of early ecosystems.

This data challenge focuses on predicting the age of ultrabasic melt samples collected from the Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc in Iran. Each sample is characterized by 34 geochemical features, and the goal is to predict its age based on the provided labels:
- Paleogene: 63-23 million years before present
- Miocene: 23-5.3 million years before present
- Plio-Quaternary: 5.3-2.6 million years before present
